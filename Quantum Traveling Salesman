Quantum computing is an emerging field with revolutionary applications in nearly every aspect of computer science. As such, I selected to work
on this project because I found quantum computing interesting to me. It was a field that I had never explored before, and I wanted to learn more. 
I felt that as part of my college experience, I should take as many opportunities as I could and broaden my horizons on what computer science has
to offer. 

This website is dedicated to the Quantum Traveling Salesman project I completed as part of my FIRE Quantum Machine Learning program.
This program is a selective research program that allows first and second year students to conduct research into a particular field alongside
a professor in their area of choice. Me and a group of 3 other students decided to conduct research into the efficiencies of two different quantum
computing models, and simulated them on the traveling salesman problem. As the peer mentor of the group, I set goals for our research and 
communicated with the professor on any issues we were facing and updated her on our progress. At the end of the semester, Me and my team
presented our findings at the annual FIRE Summit, an undergraduate research event held by the University of Maryland to other students and 
interested people. In this project, I was able to strengthen my teamwork and collaborative skills in a technical setting, as well as learn 
more about research methodologies.
