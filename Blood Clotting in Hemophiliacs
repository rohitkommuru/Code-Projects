In high school, I was part of a synthetic biology club that researched synthetic biology solutions to various issues in 
healthcare, conservation, and more. This paper, published in a high school synthetic biology journal, details a proposed method
to speed up blood clotting in people with hemophilia. While this project is not related to computer science, I learned a lot 
about how to work with others, how to research technical problems, and how to communicate technical ideas to those who may not
be familiar with the field. I enjoyed this research because it could have a direct, positive impact on those suffering from 
hemophilia. I believe my previous research in synthetic biology has given me a unique perspective when looking at computer 
science problems, and has given me an interest in how computer science may be applied to other disciplines and their respective
issues. 

As the team leader of this project, I was responsible for laying out a research plan. Our research for this project began at 
the beginning of the school year, and ended at the very end of the year with the publishing of our paper. I set goals for our 
research for our weekly meetings, and ensured that all of our team members were on track to meeting their respective goals. 
If a team member did not understand the research paper they were looking at, certain terms, or had general questions about the project,
it was my responsibility to make sure they were caught up with the rest of the team.
