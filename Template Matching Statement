One of the projects that I added to this github was my template matching project. This project was something
that I worked on that was inspired by the things that I learned in my university's FIRE program. In my freshman year,
I was able to work with a professor that conducted research into computer vision and worked on using drones to rescue
people in disaster areas. He taught me the basics of computer vision and introduced me to its applications. As a result,
I wanted to work on a project using everything that I learned in that class. 

This project is about the detection of traffic barrels on roads. In order for a self driving car to operate, it has to be able
to understand its surroundings. As such, the cameras on the self driving car need to be able to detect a traffic barrel. In the 
sample input, the image consists of a traffic barrel, a normal orange barrel, and a background of a variety of colors. The 
output image from this algorithm results in a square being drawn around the traffic barrel, showcasing that the traffic barrel was 
distinguished from its surroundings. In working on this project, I learned how to research new concepts and tools and apply them 
to a project that I wanted to create. I was able to utilize what I learned in the classroom and develop a product with real life 
applications. Furthermore, as this was a solo project, I learned how to rely on myself to solve problems I was facing to develop
something I was passionate about.
