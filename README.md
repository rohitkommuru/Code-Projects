# Code-Projects

This is a template matching project I did using OpenCV. The code in the template_matching.py file draws a box around the traffic barrel in each frame of the traffic_barrel_input video. 

Code for Document Manager is privated.

Currently working on an implementation of John Conway's Game of Life in Python.
