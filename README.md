# Code-Projects
Welcome to my Github! Here you can find most of my coding projects. Some of my projects are school associated, so the code behind these projects cannot be made public as a result. However, the code for my template matching project, personal website, and Game of Life project can be found here. The template matching project code can be found in the template_matching.py file, and the associated input and output videos are in the traffic barrel files. Personal website code is found in the website.js, website.css, and website.html files. Game of Life code is in the GameOfLife.py file. The personal website and Game of Life code is still being worked on, and upcoming projects in Ruby, Rust, and OCaml may be added soon!
